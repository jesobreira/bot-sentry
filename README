Bot Sentry
==========

Bot Sentry avoids spam on your Pidgin by auto-sending a question defined by you on the first contact. If the answer (also defined by you) is right, then the new contact will be able to talk to you.

Originally made by [David Everly](mailto:eckrider@users.sourceforge.net). This repo is an updated version by [@jesobreira](http://github.com/jesobreira) but feel free to fork & PR as well.


Installing
----------

Bot Sentry will work with PURPLE_MAJOR_VERSION 2, but you must compile
it with the major version of purple that you plan to use it with.

You must have glib and purple development headers and libraries in order
to build this package.  On Debian Etch just do the following and you'll
get everything you need:

```
apt-get install pidgin-dev
```

You'll also need intltool:

```
apt-get install intltool
```


Everything should build with the customary:

```
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

To uninstall, just enter the bot-sentry folder with the terminal and run:

```
sudo make uninstall
```

Furthermore, "./configure --help" will show all the options available
to help cope with odd setups, installations, and paths.

Improvements
------------

The [original version](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pidgin-bs/) was last updated in 2013 but still works. Anyway, by using this updated version, you will can:

* Set the whole text that will be sent to your user and not just the question (no more 'you are being ignored!')

* Set the time limit the user can reply to your captcha

* Set the success message that is sent to your buddy.
