1.1.0

	*  since pidgin/libpurple looks for plugins in a variety of
	   directories, be sure to use './configure --libdir=DIR'
	   to specify the directory where you want to install this
	   plugin
	*  you can now choose whether to use Bot Sentry with
	   individual accounts (see the advanced tab of Add/Modify
	   Account)

1.0.0

	*  Gaim is no longer supported, purple >= 2.0.0 is required
	*  automatically change any conflicting settings found in
	   the Psychic plugin
